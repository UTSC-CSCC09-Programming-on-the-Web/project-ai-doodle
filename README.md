## Project Description

**AI Doodle** is a multi-player web game that combines AI image generation, creativity, and social deduction. It challenges players to interpret and describe images in a chainâ€”while trying to identify a hidden spy.

### Game Rules

1. At the start of each round, AI randomly selects a secret word and assigns one player as the **Spy**.
2. The first player sees the word (except the spy) and enters a prompt based on the word to generate an image using AI.
3. The next player **only sees the previous image**, and writes a prompt describing what they think it is. A new image is generated based on that.
4. The process continues until the last player.
5. The last player attempts to guess the original word (or a synonym).
   - If correct, all players except the spy win.
   - If incorrect, all players view the image chain and vote on who the spy is.
     - If the spy is correctly identified, all players except the spy win.
     - Otherwise, the spy wins.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 (Single Page Application)
- **Backend**: Express.js (REST API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 (Google Login)
- **Image Generation**: OpenAI
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO (WebSockets)
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose on a Virtual Machine
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

---

## Additional Feature: Real-time Functionality

This project uses **Socket.IO** to implement real-time communication throughout the game:

- Players join a game room and take turns in real time
- Each prompt/image submission is immediately broadcast to the next player
- Voting and results are shown live to all users without needing to refresh
